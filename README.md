A Lost and Found App for KUET Campus  

---

## Overview
**Lost@KUET** is an Android mobile application developed using **Flutter** and powered by **Supabase** for backend and authentication.  
The app provides a secure, verified, and interactive platform for students of **Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET)** to manage lost and found items within the campus.  

Users can post lost or found items, search posts, communicate directly through in-app chat, and receive real-time notifications when new items are uploaded.  
The project was developed as part of the **Information System Design Lab**, integrating tools such as **Jira**, **GitHub**, and multiple system design methodologies.
